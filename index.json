The guidelines we propose are extremely simple and center around transparency regarding how chunks are encoded and scored. We demonstrate that despite the apparent simplicity of NER evaluation, unreported differences in the scoring procedure can result in changes to scores that are both of noticeable magnitude and statistically significant. We describe SeqScore, which addresses many of the issues that cause replication failures.","tags":[],"title":"SeqScore: Addressing Barriers to Reproducible Named Entity Recognition Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Adelani","Jade Abbott","Graham Neubig","Daniel D'souza","Julia Kreutzer","Constantine Lignos","Chester Palen-Michel","Happy Buzaaba","Shruti Rijhwani","Sebastian Ruder","Stephen Mayhew"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1616371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616385671,"objectID":"22285f8934ea3023ad3bfc858a8f0b77","permalink":"/publication/masakhaner/","publishdate":"2021-03-22T04:01:10.918139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masakhaner/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract We take a step towards addressing the under- representation of the African continent in NLP research by bringing together different stakeholders to create the first large, publicly available, high-quality dataset for named entity recognition (NER) in ten African languages. We detail the characteristics of these languages to help researchers and practitioners better understand the challenges they pose for NER tasks. We analyze our datasets and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of state- of-the-art methods across both supervised and transfer learning settings. Finally, we release the data, code, and models to inspire future research on African NLP.","tags":[],"title":"MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elizabeth Boschee","Joel Barry","Jayadev Billa","Marjorie Freedman","Thamme Gowda","Constantine Lignos","Chester Palen-Michel","Michael Pust","Banriskhem Kayang Khonglah","Srikanth Madikeri"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601092871,"objectID":"41aa0a6a2d175d29350a4d491124a999","permalink":"/publication/boschee-2019-saral/","publishdate":"2020-09-26T04:01:10.918139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boschee-2019-saral/","section":"publication","summary":"With the increasing democratization of electronic media, vast information resources are available in less-frequently-taught languages such as Swahili or Somali. That information, which may be crucially important and not available elsewhere, can be difficult for monolingual English speakers to effectively access. In this paper we present an end-to-end cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) and summarization system for low-resource languages that 1) enables English speakers to search foreign language repositories of text and audio using English queries, 2) summarizes the retrieved documents in English with respect to a particular information need, and 3) provides complete transcriptions and translations as needed. The SARAL system achieved the top end-to-end performance in the most recent IARPA MATERIAL CLIR+summarization evaluations. Our demonstration system provides end-to-end open query retrieval and summarization capability, and presents the original source text or audio, speech transcription, and machine translation, for two low resource languages.","tags":[],"title":"Saral: A low-resource cross-lingual domain-focused information retrieval system for effective rapid document triage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Constantine Lignos","Chester Palen-Michel","Oskar Singer","Pedro Szekely","Elizabeth Boschee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601092871,"objectID":"f5fb83e9319e29b4a800a16f24950f6c","permalink":"/publication/lignosreal/","publishdate":"2020-09-26T04:01:11.295626Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lignosreal/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic extraction of causal relations from text has the potential to aid in the understanding of complex scenarios, but to date there has been limited work exploring extraction from natural data at scale. We describe a system that implements a rich language processing pipeline for the purpose of extracting causal relations between events described in text. The system uses a syntactic pattern-based approach to causality, using mutual bootstrapping to expand a set of seed patterns by discovering additional high-reliability patterns through a human-in-the- loop approach. We evaluate the performance of the system on newswire data and explore the properties of causal relations it identifies.","tags":[],"title":"Real-World Causal Relationship Discovery from Text","type":"publication"}]
